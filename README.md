## About me üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
My name is Aleksandra Hernik. Recently, I've started broadening my IT knowledge in order to become a Software Tester. During the work in Data Management area I've noticed that tasks that interested me the most are the ones connected to testing acitivity. It is only a part of my resposibilities now and I would like to spend more time on such activity. I discovered taht a career path as a Software Tester is something that could suit me the most. Working in Data Management in the international, pharmaceutical comapnies gave me an opporunity to gain the skills that are crucial for the role of a Tester. I pay attention to detail and can successfully manage multiple tasks under limited-time. <br>
When I started digging into testing topic, I completed basic software tesing course and I only made sure that this is something that I'm interested in. After that I joined a QA Challenge organised by Dare IT. During this course I had a chance to perform weekly tasks that made up a final project. Each stage was based on materials and feedback received from experts.<br>
Now I'm looking for a position to become a Juionior Tester.

## Experience üíº

I'm working as a Clinical Data Coordinator in a clinical trials area. I participated in Set-Up phase when the special environment for study team is built. I created edit checks, wrote test cases and executed tests. I also was responsible for performing UAT for data validation listings, protocol deviation listings. I collaboratively worked with the programming team to see issues found through re-testing and resolution both during initial database set up and for migration. In addition to that, I'm part of international study team, which gave me a chance to practice english in a daily basis.
